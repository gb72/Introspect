<div class="articles">
   		<p>"The art being displayed conveyed certain deep emotions that really connected me to the experience of the artist. And this made me realise that as such a complex issue, the feeling surrounding mental illness can be something which we find difficult to express. The artwork within the exhibition was an emotional outlet, and is a part of a much wider movement to de-stigmatise mental illness. This can only become reality through better understanding and the basic and necessary acceptance that, for a hell of a lot of people, this is a natural part of life - and that's totally okay!" (Article by Maria Vint). </p>

		 <p> "The amount of work submitted was very impressive. Some works had the names of their artists printed underneath with small captions explaining how the artwork came to life and what it was reflecting. What struck me as very interesting and surprising was that it is very difficult to admit to having a mental health problem in a society where anything different is usually poked fun at or cast aside. For people to embrace their differences and to express them through art doesn't just help mental health sufferers to cope with their problems, but it also encourages people who do not experience these problems to feel connected to those that do." (Article by Ipek Kozanoglu)" </p>
